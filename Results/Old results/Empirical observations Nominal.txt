Extra noise vs normal noise
	normal noise = higher accuracy by ~10%
		except in no feature selection, check attack type
			Extra noise =

Sometimes the classifiers predict 0 instances of a class
	0 precision, 0 recall
	SMO: most common classifier that gives 0
	Occurs more often in Extra noise

		Classes with 0 precision and 0 recall sometimes
			slowRead (Most common)
			slowHeaders
			tcpFlood
			udpFlood

And sometimes, they predict a class perfectly
	1 precision, 1 recall

Sometimes isAttack is better than single, but attack type brings the accuracy down
